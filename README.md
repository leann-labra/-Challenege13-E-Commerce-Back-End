# -Challenege13-E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

This project is focused on honing skills working in the backend. This challenge is geared towards working with how to make backend changes to a MYSQL database using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. This is practice with working in the backend of how an e-commerce store would be structured. The hardest part of this project for me was primarily building the routes to the access the correct database models I needed. Another aspect was still familiarizing myself with how to use Insomnia to troubleshoot, and find where I had sequelize validation errors and other technical difficulties. All in all, I feel that this project brought me a better understanding of not only how to build routes, but also how to build a dynamic database using MySQL.
